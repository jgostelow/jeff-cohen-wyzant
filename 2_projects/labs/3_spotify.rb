# Spotify API
#
# Let's build a small app that:
# 1. prompts the user for a musical artist
# 2. displays the album titles for that artist

# Here's an example of how to use the Spotify web service
# to search for albums by the Beatles:
#
# https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=album&q=Beatles
#
# (The name of the artist should go in the q= portion of the above url.)
#
# That should be enough information, but here
# are some more resources you might find handy:

# After this session, you can try: 4_number_guesser.rb

# Let's learn about iteration so we can automate things.

# puts "Howdy"
# puts "Howdy"
# puts "Howdy"
# puts "Howdy"
# puts "Howdy"


# We can use a "while" loop:

i = 1
while i <= 5 do
  puts "Howdy"
  i += 1
end

# We can use a "for" loop.
fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "cookies"]

for fruit in fruits
  puts fruit

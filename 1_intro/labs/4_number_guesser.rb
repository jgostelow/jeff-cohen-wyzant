# Write a Guess the Number game.## The computer picks a random number between 1-100 and prompts the player# to guess that number. Each time the  player guesses, the computer should#  give the player a hint as to whether the number is too high or too low.# The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the# player guesses the correct number,the computer should present the number#  of guesses and ask if the player would like to play again.## Example Output:##        Let's play Guess the Number.##        I have my number. What's your guess? 1#        Too low.  Guess again: 5#        Too high. Guess again: 2#        You got it in 3 guesses!#        Play again? n#        Goodbye!## Constraints# • Don’t allow any non-numeric data entry.# • Map the number of guesses taken to comments:#   – 1 guess: "You’re a mind reader!"#   – 2–4 guesses: "Most impressive."#   – 3–6 guesses: "You can do better than that."#   – 7 or more guesses: "Better luck next time."

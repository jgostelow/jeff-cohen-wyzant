# Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful# for creating word clouds and other types of word analysis. And it’s more# useful when running it against lots of text.## Create a program that reads the file "macbeth.txt" and counts the frequency# of words. Then construct a histogram displaying the words# and their frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.## Example Output:## Given the text file words.txt with this content:#        badger badger badger#        badger mushroom mushroom#        snake badger badger badger## the program should produce the following output:##        badger:   *******#        mushroom: **#        snake:    *## Constraint# • Ensure that the most-used word is at the top of the report#   and the least-used words are at the bottom.

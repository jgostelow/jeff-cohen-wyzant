## !Strings# Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string.# But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by# using escape characters.## Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the# quotation and author as shown in the example output.## Example Output:##   What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.#   Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi##   Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."## Constraints# • Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate#   string-escaping techniques for quotes.# • Do not use string interpolation. Use string concatenation instead.
